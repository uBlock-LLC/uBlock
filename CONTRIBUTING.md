### Before you submit

1. Please submit bugs/issues only.
1. Make sure your issue [hasn't already been fixed in a recent release](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/releases). That's good news!
1. Verify that the issue does **not** occur with uBlock disabled. If it still occurs with uBlock disabled, it's probably not an issue with uBlock.

### What to include


To help us diagnose and fix the problem, please always, always include the following in your report:

* A clear list of steps to reproduce the problem
  * **Always include a URL**, _even_ if "it happens everywhere".
* Symptoms of the issue
  * Describe what you observe and consider broken behavior; this is what we'll be looking for after executing the steps
  * Example: video doesn't start playing, page layout broken
* A screenshot of **any** of uBlock's preferences that differ from the defaults
  * This includes a whitelisted website, enabled/disabled filter list, anything
  * Please do include everything different from the defaults whether or not it seems relevant to your issue
* The version of uBlock you're having the issue with; you can find this in [uBlock's popup UI](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface)
  * Example: `uBlock 0.9.0.0`
* The browser you're using and its version
  * Examples: `Firefox 36`, `Safari 8.0.5`, `Chrome 41.0.2272` 
* The OS you're using and its version
  * Examples: `OS X 10.10`, `Windows 8.1`, `Linux Mint 17.1`
* A list of other extensions you have installed
  * Tip: try disabling them and see if your issue still occurs

By following this format, you'd be greatly increasing the efficiency of resolving the issue.

Otherwise, we've noticed that a lot of ***your*** time (and the developers') gets thrown away on exchanging back and forth to get this information.

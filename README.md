# µBlock for Chromium

**Foreword:** Using a blocker is **NOT** [theft](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/518154828166725632). Do not fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of "blocking = theft" is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.

See [releases page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases) for recent changes.
See [Wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki) for more information.

An efficient blocker for Chromium-based browsers. Fast and lean. Written from scratch. Development
through benchmarking.

**µBlock is not an "ad blocker", it's a blocker in the broad sense**, which happens to block ads through its support of [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). µBlock  [extends](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax.

_EasyList_, _Peter Lowe's Adservers_ , _EasyPrivacy_ are enabled by default when you install µBlock. Many more lists are readily available to protect yourself from trackers, analytics, data mining, and more ads. Hosts files are supported.

Ads are just the visible portions of privacy-invading apparatus entering your browser when you visit most sites nowadays.

My main goal with µBlock is to help users neutralize as much as can be privacy-invading apparatus (of which ads, "unintrusive" or not, are just the visible portion) for users who do not want to deal with more technical means like [µMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix).

µBlock: on average, it <b>really</b> does make your browser run leaner<br>

[**Important note re memory usage**: there is currently a [bug in Chromium 39+ which causes a new memory leak each time the popup UI of an extension is opened](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=441500). This affects *all* extensions. Just so you are informed memory figures won't be too reliable as soon as you opened even only once the popup UI of an extension. (In all my benchmarks I of course avoided to do this).]

Being lean doesn't mean blocking less.<br>

## Installation

From the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), the [Opera store](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/ublock/), or [manually](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/tree/master/dist#install).

To benefit from the higher efficiency, it is of course not advised to use an
inefficient blocker at the same time. µBlock will do as well or better than the
popular blockers out there.

## Documentation

I think it is pretty obvious, except for this I suppose:

![Popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1.png)&emsp; ![Popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-2.png)

The big power button is to disable/enable µBlock **for the specific hostname
which can be extracted from the URL address of the current page**. (It applies to
the current web site only, it is **not** a global power button.) The state of the power
switch for a specific site will be remembered.

The right-hand screenshot shows optional [dynamic filtering](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering) at work.

## About

µBlock is born out of [HTTP Switchboard](https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard).
All the niceties of HTTPSB have been removed, and what is left is a straightforward
blocker which support EasyList and the likes, and also support host files.
Cosmetic filters ("element hiding") are supported.

There is nothing more to it. But it does what popular blockers out there do, at a
fraction of CPU and memory usage for the same blocking power. Also, no unique user id
and no home means no phoning home (some popular blockers do this, just be careful).

Free. Open source. For users by users. No donations sought.

Without the preset lists of filters, this extension is nothing. So if ever you
really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard
to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by
all for free.

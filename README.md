## Getting started

#### Installation:

* **Chrome**: available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock/epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn) or for [manual](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/tree/master/dist#install) installation.

* **Safari**: available to install [from the homepage](https://www.ublock.org/), or from the [Safari Extension Gallery](https://extensions.apple.com/details/?id=net.gorhill.uBlock-96G4BAKDQ9).

* **Firefox**: available on the [Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock/), or for [manual](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/releases) installation.

 * Due to Mozilla's review process, the version of uBlock available from the Add-ons homepage is currently often outdated. This isn't in our control.

* **Opera**: Opera shares Chrome's underlying engine, so you can install uBlock simply by grabbing the [latest release for Chrome](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/releases/latest).

uBlock has tooltips throughout its UI to help you along. But just in case you need it, [here's a quick guide for basic usage](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface).

## Performance

#### Memory

<p align="center">
On average, uBlock <b>really</b> does make your browser run leaner. <sup>[1]</sup><br><br>

#### CPU

<p align="center">
uBlock is also CPU-efficient<br>

#### Blocking

<p align="center">
Being lean and efficient doesn't mean blocking less<br>

## Tips

* **To benefit from uBlock's higher efficiency,** it's advised that you don't use other inefficient blockers at the same time (such as AdBlock or Adblock Plus). uBlock will do [as well or better](#blocking) than most popular ad blockers.

* It's important to note that blocking ads [is *not* theft](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/518154828166725632). Don't fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.

* _EasyList_, _Peter Lowe's Adservers_, _EasyPrivacy_ and _Malware domains_ are enabled by default when you install uBlock. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers, analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.

* Once you install uBlock, you can easily un-select any of the pre-selected filter lists if you think uBlock blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only _EasyList_ enabled by default.

* Feel free to read [about the extension's required permissions](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/About-the-required-permissions).

## About uBlock

Some users might want to check out [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): a noteworthy personal fork of uBlock from @gorhill with a slightly different featureset.

uBlock is a general-purpose blocker — not an *ad blocker* specifically. uBlock's main goal is to help users neutralize privacy-invading apparatus — ads being one example.

uBlock blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). uBlock [extends](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters.

Free and open-source. For users, by users.

**Note:** There used to be a donation link here, soliciting donations from users. It has been removed due to ethical concerns, and the authors of uBlock express their sincerest apoligies for the unacceptable length of time for which it had been present.

[Feel free to read about uBlock's development philosophy](https://chrismatic.io/ublock/philosophy) and [uBlock's manifesto](MANIFESTO.md).

*Acknowledgment:* uBlock comes with several filter lists ready to use out-of-the-box (including but not limited to: EasyList, Peter Lowe's, several malware filter lists). We deeply appreciate the people working hard to maintain those lists which are available to use by all for free.

## What is uBlock?

uBlock is a general-purpose blocker — not an *ad blocker* specifically.

uBlock blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). uBlock [extends](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters.

uBlock's main goal is to help users neutralize privacy-invading apparatus — ads being one example.

<sup>[2] Important note: There is currently a [bug in Chromium 39+ which causes a new memory leak each time the popup UI of an extension is opened](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=441500). This affects <i>all</i> extensions. Keep this in mind when measuring Chromium's memory usage. In the benchmarks, I avoided opening the popups completely.</sup><br>

#### CPU

<p align="center">
uBlock is also easy on the CPU<br>

#### Blocking

<p align="center">
Being lean and efficient doesn't mean blocking less<br>

## Release History

## Tips

* **To benefit from uBlock's higher efficiency,** it's advised that you don't use other inefficient blockers at the same time (such as AdBlock or Adblock Plus). uBlock will do [as well or better](#blocking) than most popular ad blockers.

* It's important to note that blocking ads [is *not* theft](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/518154828166725632). Don't fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.

* _EasyList_, _Peter Lowe's Adservers_, _EasyPrivacy_ and _Malware domains_ are enabled by default when you install uBlock. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers, analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.

* Once you install uBlock, you can easily un-select any of the pre-selected filter lists if you think uBlock blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only _EasyList_ enabled by default.

* Feel free to read [about the extension's required permissions](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/wiki/About-the-required-permissions).

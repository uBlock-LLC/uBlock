## Philosophy

µBlock is not merely an *ad blocker*; it's a general-purpose blocker. µBlock blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). µBlock [extends](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters.

That said, it's important to note that using a blocker is **NOT** [theft](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/518154828166725632). Don't fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.

Ads, "unintrusive" or not, are just the visible portions of privacy-invading apparatus entering your browser when you visit most sites nowadays. **µBlock's main goal is to help users neutralize such privacy-invading apparatus** — in a way that welcomes those users who don't wish to use more technical, involved means (such as [µMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix)).

_EasyList_, _Peter Lowe's Adservers_, _EasyPrivacy_ and _Malware domains_ are enabled by default when you install µBlock. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers, analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.

## Performance

#### Memory

<div align="center">
On average, µBlock <b>really</b> does make your browser run leaner. <sup>[1]</sup><br><br>

Chromium <sup>[2]</sup><br>

<sup>[2] Important note: There is currently a [bug in Chromium 39+ which causes a new memory leak each time the popup UI of an extension is opened](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=441500). This affects <i>all</i> extensions. Keep this in mind when measuring Chromium's memory usage. In the benchmarks, I avoided opening the popups completely.</sup><br>

#### CPU

<p align="center">
µBlock is also easy on the CPU<br>

#### Blocking

<p align="center">
Being lean and efficient doesn't mean blocking less<br>

## Installation

Feel free to read [about the extension's required permissions](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/About-the-required-permissions).

#### Chromium

You can install the latest version [manually](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/tree/master/dist#install), from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), or from the [Opera store](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/ublock/).

#### Firefox

Install from [Firefox Add-ons homepage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock/), or you can install by downloading the latest [uBlock.firefox.xpi](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases) file, and by dragging the downloaded `xpi` file to your add-on page.

#### Safari

##### 8.0 or newer only

You can get and install the latest µBlock for Safari **[right here](https://chrismatic.io/ublock/)**.

µBlock is also available on the [Safari Extension Gallery](https://extensions.apple.com/details/?id=net.gorhill.uBlock-96G4BAKDQ9), although that's not guaranteed to be the latest version.

<sup>Safari versions prior to 8.0 have a bug triggering a crash during µBlock installation. It's not recommended that you attempt to install µBlock on them (*if you must, do it at your own risk*).</sup>

#### Note for all browsers

To benefit from µBlock's higher efficiency, it's advised that you don't use other inefficient blockers at the same time (such as AdBlock or Adblock Plus). µBlock will do [as well or better](#blocking) than most popular ad blockers.

## About

[µBlock's manifesto](MANIFESTO.md).

Free. Open source. For users by users. No donations sought.

Without the preset lists of filters, this extension is nothing. So if ever you
really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard
to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by
all for free.

You can contribute by helping translate µBlock [on Crowdin](https://crowdin.net/project/ublock).

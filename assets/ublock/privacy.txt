# ÂµBlock -- Privacy
# Status: experimental
#
# Experimental list: use only if you don't mind potential breakage, I just
# don't have the resource to deal with lists, I do it because blocking these
# are in the interest of users.
#
# These filters make use of the `important` filter option, which purpose is
# to guarantee that a filter won't be overriden by exception filters.
#
# I will use data from benchmarks to decide what to add here.

# I think web sites can live without this
# Commented out on 2014-10-03: I don't see it anymore in benchmarks. Will see.
# Commenting it out allows me to enable this one out-of-the-box.
